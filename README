1. What Is AB-Transfers ?
=========================

AB-Transfers is an application for online money transfers of any kind.

In contrast to KMyMoney or Gnucash it is not intended to be used as a
complete accounting application but is intended to be used as a companion
to them to perform money transfers that they don't support.

The homepage of AB-Transfers is (German)
http://schmufu.dyndns.org/dokuwiki/ab_transfer:start


1.1. AqBanking
--------------

AB-Transfers uses the library AqBanking for all online money transfers
and should support all transfer types that AqBanking offers.

From the README file of AqBanking:

The homepage of AqBanking is http://www.aqbanking.de/
(Note: Information in German can be found on http://linuxwiki.de/AqBanking )

The intention of AqBanking is to provide a middle layer between the program
and the various Online Banking libraries (e.g. AqHBCI, OpenHBCI etc). 


1.2. Supported Transfers
------------------------

AB-Transfers currently (Version 0.0.4.0) supports:

- National Single Transfers
- Internal Transfers
- Dated Transfers (creation, editing and deletion)
- Standing Orders (creation, editing and deletion)
- SEPA Transfers


1.3. Bank/Account Information
-----------------------------

AB-Transfers can call the "AqBanking Setup" to create and/or modify the
accounts to use.



2. Supported Platforms
======================

AB-Transfers uses the library AqBanking (http://www.aqbanking.de/) for the
communication with the Bank and Qt (http://qt.digia.com) for the GUI.

So it should work on any system for which these are available.



3. What Do I Need ?
===================


3.1. Required Packages
----------------------

AB-Transfers has several direct dependencies:

- "AqBanking" >= 5.0.14 (>= 5.0.27 for SEPA support), available from
  http://www.aqbanking.de/
- "Gwenhywfar" >= 3.99.0, available from http://gwenhywfar.sf.net
- "Qt" >= 4.6.3, available from http://qt.digia.com



4. Building AqBanking
=====================


4.1. Building from the Tar File
-------------------------------

Download the tar.bz2 archive from http://schmufu.dyndns.org/abtransfers/source/

extract the archive with (replace x.x.x.x with the version number)
#> tar -xjf abtransfers-x.x.x.x.tar.bz2

change into the new directory
#> cd abtransfers-x.x.x.x

run qmake and make to compile
#> qmake
#> make

after this the executeable 'abtransfers' is located in the build directory
and could be executed
#> ./build/abtransfers


4.2. Building from SVN
----------------------

Get the source from the svn repository at
http://schmufu.dyndns.org/svn/ab_transfers/trunk

Then run 'qmake' and 'make' as described in "4.1. Building from the Tar File".


4.3. Building the Documentation
-----------------------------------

The documentation is build by doxygen in the documentation directory

#> cd documentation
#> doxygen

The created documentation can be viewed with every Browser by opening
 documentaion/doxygen/html/index.html



5. Directories and Files Used
=============================

Per default AB-Transfers saves all Settings and Configurations in the users
home directory in the folder .abtransfers

- accountdata.ctx
  In this file the current account information are stored.
  This includes data for dated transfers and standing orders.

- history.ctx
  All executed transfers are saved in this file.

- recipients.txt
  The "known recipients" are saved in this file.

The default folder and the path and filename of the above files could be
changed in the settings of AB-Transfers.

- settings.ini
  All configurations of AB-Transfers are saved in this file. It must exist
  in the $HOME/.abtransfers directory.



6. Thanks

- Martin Preuss (for the great work in AqBanking)
- Micha Lenk (for maintaining packages for debian and ubuntu)
- Heinz Sachsenweger (for helping and testing various versions)

- and of course all others who submitted bug reports, patches and feedback !!
