Parallel Install (packaged and locally created)
###############################################

This description is only for experienced users and not detailed enough if any
errors occoured during the process.

Creating a paralell installation to the installed system packages of aqbanking
and gwenhywfar is descriped here for the compilation and usage of AB-Transfers
(and kMyMmoney) with newer versions of AqBanking than your distribution
supplies.

.. warning:

    It could break other distribution installed packages!


Installation dependencies
=========================

Depending on your use case the following packages (debian) should be installed
if you need to use a card reader like the Reiner SCT standard (cyberjack).

    - pcscd
    - pcsc-tools
    - libifd-cyberjack6


FinTS URL
---------

Depending on how old your HBCI chipcard is (Mine is from 2001) the at the card
stored HBCI/FinTS URL might be outdated. See [1] for a recently updated list.
The currently correct URL should be entered at the AqBanking setup dialog.


Configure, build and install the local installations

In this description we use "/opt/aqb" for the prefix, change it if your
installation must be anywere else and adjust all ocurences to your destination.
